# LocalStatus

Automatically monitors the important parts of your local development environment. Not in a fancy way.
Just in a fifteen-year-old-Honda-Civic kind of way.

* Ping your local services
* Verify needed files exist
* Keep an eye on Git repos
* and more

## Example

```
$ localstatus
    6 checks to run...
OK  Database service
OK  Database migrations
OK  API service
OK  Env vars
!   VPN connection
OK  Redis
( exit code 1 )

$ localstatus --watch
    6 checks to run, every 3 minutes...
    (Enter to re-run, Ctrl-C to stop)
```

The configuration looks like this:

```toml
# ~/.config/localstatus.toml
checks = [
    {check = "tcp.open", address = "localhost:3306", label = "MySQL"},
    {check = "tcp.open", address = "localhost:6379", label = "Redis"},
    {check = "database.migrated", tool = "flyway", directory = "~/dev/proj/db"},
    {check = "http.ok", url = "http://localhost:9000/api/ping", label = "API server"},
    {check = "env", variables_required = ["API_KEY", "ENVIRONMENT_MODE"]},
    {check = "http.ok", url = "https://corp.private.example.com", label = "VPN connection"},
]
```

## Motivation

At work, my local development environment needs to be _just so._ I need to remember to connect to
the VPN, run the Azurite cloud storage emulator, and check the local status pages of about twelve
services in case one of them has a problem. I need to make sure my repositories aren't falling too
far behind my team, my database has the latest migrations, and I've run `npm install` since the
last update to `package.json`. And there are local files that need to exist even though they aren't
checked in to source control.

That's a lot of moving pieces, so of course, I created a tool to check them all for me.

- This project was almost named Brock, because GitHub generated a repo name of "friendly-broccoli."
- This project was almost named Checkmate, generated by ChatGPT.
- This project was almost named ldca, for Local Development is Cool Again.
- This project was almost named Local Host Checker, for the cool acronym LHC.
